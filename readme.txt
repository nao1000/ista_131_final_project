There are a couple of things to address here. The datasets folder was what was originally intended to be used for the whole project. The dataset
has a file that contains who won which postseason event over the years. I also used the team stats for each season from the original dataset. I created
WSwinners and WinnersWithOPSandERA with the given datasets. 

The other two figures use the files with the (BR) endings. This data is the league average of batting and pitching stats from 1871 to 2023. 
I had originally wanted to use data from Baseball Reference but the datasets weren't free. However, when I went back to it, I realized I could copy and paste it into a text file, alter some things around, convert them into CSV files, and have what I wanted. 

Everything else should be fine. When running the DisplayFigures.py (which shows all of the figures at once), please look at them in fullscreen.
It was my intention to have them in full-screen and they look best there.
